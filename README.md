## About the Project 🔍
In this project it was necessary to develop an *API*, where it is possible to search and find employees of the company Peoples with their due data.

The studies with this project started on <ins>**03/23/2021**</ins> and ended on <ins>**04/12/2021**</ins>.

## Development Process 📈
This project was divided into a few sprints to be able to organize it properly throughout the development process.

There will be a total of 3 development sprints:


* _**SPRINT 1 - <ins>DATABASE**_</ins> 🎨<br>
Sprint responsible for developing the modeling of a relational database, in this case, *Microsoft SQL Server* will be used. The modeling will have the *conceptual model*, *logical* and *physical*. The part of the Scripts will be used the segregations **DDL** (Creating tables), **DML** (Inserting records in tables) and **DQL** (Selection and reading of data) for the configuration of DATABASE according to the models.


* _**SPRINT 2 - <ins>BACK-END**_</ins> 🔙<br>
Sprint responsible for the development of the entire structure behind the application, where **C#** was used as the *main language* for this project which also had other technologies and resources for its development, such as: **.NET**, the **WEB API** and among others *Frameworks* and *Models*.


* _**SPRINT 3 - <ins>POSTMAN**_</ins> 📰 <br>
Sprint responsible for the development of the collections organization within **POSTMAN**, which is where we receive the *requests* made in the BACK-END and which is *returned* to us by the POSTMAN program the required values.
